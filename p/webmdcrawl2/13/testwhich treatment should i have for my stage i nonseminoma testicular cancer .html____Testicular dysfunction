          <p>For most men faced with testicular cancer, surgery to remove the affected testicle (radical inguinal orchiectomy) is the first treatment. After you have completed this step, you and your doctor will discuss your options for further treatment.</p> 
          <p>If you are diagnosed with nonseminoma testicular cancer and tests suggest that it has not spread beyond the testicles (testes), you might have choices. Your options may include a watchful waiting program, chemotherapy to kill any stray cancer cells, or surgery to remove the lymph nodes in your lower back (retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, or RPLND). Think about the following when making your decision:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>If your biggest concern is that testicular cancer might come back elsewhere in your body (metastasize), consider RPLND or chemotherapy. These treatments are the best options for completely getting rid of the cancer. </li> 
           <li>RPLND surgery and chemotherapy do have risks. Watchful waiting allows you to avoid these risks, at least for now.</li> 
           <li>You could be one of the 1 out of 4 men who get cancer again after a period of watchful waiting.<sup class="Reference">1</sup> If so, you may need to have more aggressive treatment than if you have RPLND or chemotherapy right after your orchiectomy.</li> 
           <li>If you are willing to follow a schedule of regular checkups and tests, you can consider watchful waiting. If cancer comes back, it is important to treat it in its early stage. </li> 
           <li>If you want to avoid the intense follow-up required for watchful waiting but are worried that RPLND or chemotherapy might harm your fertility, ask your doctor about sperm banking before treatment.</li>

          <h4>What is stage I nonseminoma testicular cancer?</h4> 
          <p>Testicular cancer is a disease involving the uncontrolled growth of cells on or inside the testicles, or testes. </p> 
          <p>There are two main types of testicular cancer: seminoma and nonseminoma germ-cell tumors (also called NSGCTs). Unlike seminomas, nonseminomas tend to be very resistant to radiation therapy. Nonseminoma cells are also more likely to travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, liver, bones, and brain.</p> 
          <p>Stage I cancers are those that are believed to be confined to the testes, though in some cases they may have spread to the lymph nodes of the lower back (retroperitoneum) but cannot be detected.</p> 
          <p>Both seminomas and nonseminomas are highly curable, especially when they are diagnosed and treated early. When compared to other forms of cancer, even those testicular cancers that have spread beyond the testes to other parts of the body have a very high cure rate.</p> 
          <h4>What are the treatment choices for stage I nonseminoma germ-cell tumors?</h4> 
          <p>Following orchiectomy, stage I nonseminoma germ-cell tumors (NSGCTs) are usually treated with additional surgery, chemotherapy, or watchful waiting. NSGCTs are rarely treated with radiation therapy.</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li> <b>Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND)</b> is surgery to remove lymph nodes that may be cancerous from the lower back and pelvis. During the early phases of stage I nonseminoma testicular cancer, it can be very difficult to tell whether these lymph nodes are cancerous without surgically removing them first. In the past, RPLND was associated with high rates of infertility. Modern &quot;nerve-sparing&quot; and laparoscopic surgical techniques have lowered the chances of becoming infertile following RPLND.</li> 
           <li> <b>Chemotherapy</b>. Chemotherapy is the use of very powerful medicines to kill cancer cells. The most common chemotherapy used to treat nonseminoma testicular cancer is called cisplatin combination therapy and involves the use of several different medicines. This treatment varies in intensity and is often used for men whose cancer has spread beyond the testes to lymph nodes or other organs.</li> 
           <li> <b>Watchful waiting</b> means you are being monitored closely by your doctor but are not receiving active treatment such as surgery or chemotherapy. Men who choose watchful waiting for stage I nonseminomas usually have monthly physical exams, chest X-rays, and blood tests for the first year as well as one CT scan every 3 months. If no recurrent cancer is found, the number of physical exams and blood and imaging tests will gradually decrease to about one a year after 5 years following orchiectomy.<sup class="Reference">2</sup> This follow-up work can be hard for some men to do.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <h4>What are the risks of RPLND?</h4> 
          <p>RPLND is a surgical procedure and carries all the risks of any major surgery, including:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Reactions to anesthesia or medicines.</li> 
           <li>Infection.</li> 
           <li>Bleeding.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p> RPLND can cause retrograde ejaculation, which can make you infertile. This can happen as a result of nerve damage caused by the surgery. With retrograde ejaculation, the semen flows from the prostate gland into the bladder rather than out through the penis. </p> 
          <p>Men with retrograde ejaculation typically do not have erection problems or difficulty enjoying sex.</p> 
          <p>Laparoscopic and other <b>&quot;nerve-sparing&quot; techniques</b> now used in many RPLND surgeries have greatly lowered the risk of retrograde ejaculation following RPLND. Studies show that 95% of men who have nerve-sparing RPLND have normal ejaculation after surgery.<sup class="Reference">2</sup> Nerve-sparing RPLND surgery may be more difficult or impossible for men who have previously had chemotherapy treatment for cancer. Talk to your doctor about whether nerve-sparing surgery is possible for you.</p> 
          <p>Other risks associated with RPLND include:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Postoperative pain.</li> 
           <li> Chylous ascites, a condition in which digestive fluids collect inside the abdominal (belly) cavity. This may lead to abdominal pain and difficulty breathing.</li> 
           <li>Lymphedema, which is a collection of fluid that causes swelling (edema) in the arms and legs. This type of edema occurs when the amount of lymph fluid in a person's arm or leg exceeds the body's ability to remove it, and the fluid then collects in the tissues of the limb. </li> 
           <li>Excessive bleeding (hemorrhage). </li> 
           <li>Pulmonary embolism, which is a sudden blockage of arterial blood flow within the lung.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <h4>What are the risks of chemotherapy?</h4> 
          <p>Chemotherapy affects rapidly growing cells in your body. Besides cancer cells, this includes blood cells, hair cells, and the cells that line your digestive tract. Common short-term side effects include nausea and vomiting, hair thinning or hair loss, mouth sores, diarrhea, and an increased chance of bleeding and infection. Many men do not have problems with these side effects. Other men have a great deal of difficulty. If you have problems, your doctor can use other medicines to help relieve some of these side effects.</p> 
          <p>Combination chemotherapy for the treatment of testicular cancer has also been associated with serious long-term side effects. These side effects are uncommon. They include high blood pressure, increased cholesterol levels, kidney, heart, and lung damage, and also an increased risk of secondary cancers including leukemia and melanoma.<sup class="Reference">1</sup> (But these long-term side effects have been linked to higher doses of chemotherapy than are usually used for stage I testicular cancers.) Before beginning treatment, talk to your doctor about any concerns you may have about the long-term side effects of chemotherapy.</p> 
          <p>Chemotherapy for treatment of testicular cancer has been linked to permanent infertility in some men. Most men diagnosed with testicular cancer are younger than 35, so fertility issues are often important in determining which treatment they receive. Most chemotherapy does not permanently affect healthy sperm counts, but many doctors recommend sperm banking prior to any treatment for testicular cancer for those men who may wish to have children. Talk to your doctor about any fertility concerns you have. </p> 
          <h4>What are the risks of watchful waiting?</h4> 
          <p> About 25% of men (1 out of 4) who choose watchful waiting instead of RPLND following orchiectomy will have their cancer return and will need chemotherapy.<sup class="Reference">1</sup> Watchful waiting is a reasonable choice for many men with stage I nonseminoma testicular cancer. But watchful waiting depends on diligent follow-up care by you and your doctor. </p> 
          <p>In most cases of careful watchful waiting, recurrent cancer is confined to lymph nodes in the lower back and pelvis. This can usually be successfully treated when the testing schedule has been closely followed and the cancer is discovered when it first appears. </p> 
          <p>Cancer that appears in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes during watchful waiting may require more aggressive therapy than if RPLND or chemotherapy had been done right after orchiectomy. </p>

Although rare, testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer in men aged 15 to 35. Testicular cancer is among the more curable cancers, even at an advanced stage, thanks to improved detection and treatment. There is a higher incidence in men who had or have a condition called an undescended testicle, who have fertility problems, and who've had a father with the disease. Symptoms include swelling and hardening of a testicle and a change in its shape or size. Treatment includes surgically removing the cancerous testicle, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Follow the links below to find WebMD's comprehensive coverage about testicular cancer, its causes, symptoms, treatments, and much
