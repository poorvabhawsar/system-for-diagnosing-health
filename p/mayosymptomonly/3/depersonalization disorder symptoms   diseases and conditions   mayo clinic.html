<p>Depersonalization disorder symptoms include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Continuous or recurring feelings that you're an outside observer of your thoughts, your body or parts of your body </li> 
 <li>Numbing of your senses or responses to the world around you </li> 
 <li>Feeling like a robot or feeling like you're living in a dream or in a movie </li> 
 <li>The sensation that you aren't in control of your actions, including speaking </li> 
 <li>Awareness that your sense of detachment is only a feeling, and not reality </li> 
</ul> 
<p>Other symptoms can include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>The sense that your body, legs or arms appear distorted, enlarged or shrunken </li> 
 <li>Feeling like you are observing yourself from above, as if you were floating in the air </li> 
 <li>Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about </li> 
</ul> 
<p>While episodes of depersonalization may last only a short time, some people with depersonalization disorder have episodes that last hours, days, weeks or even months at a time. In some people these episodes turn into ongoing feelings of depersonalization that may periodically get better or worse. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>Passing feelings of depersonalization are common, and aren't necessarily a cause for concern. But ongoing or severe feelings of detachment can be a sign of depersonalization disorder or another physical or mental health condition. See a doctor if you have feelings of depersonalization that: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Are disturbing you or are emotionally disruptive </li> 
 <li>Don't go away, or keep coming back </li> 
 <li>Interfere with work, relationships or daily activities </li> 
</ul>
