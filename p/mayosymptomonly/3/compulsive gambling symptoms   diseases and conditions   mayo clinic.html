<p>Signs and symptoms of compulsive (pathologic) gambling include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Gaining a thrill from taking big gambling risks </li> 
 <li>Taking increasingly bigger gambling risks </li> 
 <li>Preoccupation with gambling </li> 
 <li>Reliving past gambling experiences </li> 
 <li>Gambling as a way to escape problems or feelings of helplessness, guilt or depression </li> 
 <li>Taking time from work or family life to gamble </li> 
 <li>Concealing or lying about gambling </li> 
 <li>Feeling guilt or remorse after gambling </li> 
 <li>Borrowing money or stealing to gamble </li> 
 <li>Failed efforts to cut back on gambling </li> 
</ul> 
<p>On rare occasions, gambling becomes a problem with the very first wager. But more often, a gambling problem progresses over time. In fact, many people spend years enjoying social gambling without any problems. But more frequent gambling or life stresses can turn casual gambling into something much more serious.</p> 
<p>During periods of stress or depression, the urge to gamble may be especially overpowering, serving as an unhealthy escape. Eventually, a person with a gambling problem becomes almost completely preoccupied with gambling and getting money to gamble.</p> 
<p>For many compulsive gamblers, betting isn't as much about money as it is about the excitement. Sustaining the thrill that gambling provides usually involves taking increasingly bigger risks and placing larger bets. Those bets may involve sums you can't afford to lose.</p> 
<p>Unlike most casual gamblers who stop when losing or set a loss limit, compulsive gamblers are compelled to keep playing to recover their money â€” a pattern that becomes increasingly destructive over time.</p> 
<p>Some compulsive gamblers may have remission where they gamble less or not at all for a period of time. However, without treatment, the remission usually isn't permanent.</p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor or mental health provider</h3> 
<p>Have family members, friends or co-workers expressed concern about your gambling? If so, listen to their worries. Because denial is almost always a characteristic of compulsive or addictive behavior, it may be difficult for you to recognize that you have a problem.</p> 
<p>Gambling is out of control if:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>It's affecting your relationships, finances, or work or school life </li> 
 <li>You're devoting more and more time and energy to gambling </li> 
 <li>You've unsuccessfully tried to stop or cut back on your gambling </li> 
 <li>You try to conceal your gambling from family or others </li> 
 <li>You resort to theft or fraud to get gambling money </li> 
 <li>You ask others to bail you out of financial woes because you've gambled money away </li> 
</ul>
