<p>The first indication of the common cold in a baby is often: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>A congested or runny nose</li> 
 <li>Nasal discharge that may be clear at first but then usually becomes thicker and turns shades of yellow or green</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Other signs of a common cold may include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>A low-grade fever of about 100.4 F (38 C)</li> 
 <li>Sneezing</li> 
 <li>Coughing</li> 
 <li>Decreased appetite</li> 
 <li>Irritability</li> 
 <li>Difficulty sleeping</li> 
 <li>Trouble nursing or taking a bottle due to nasal congestion</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>Your baby's immune system will need time to mature. If your baby has a cold with no complications, it should resolve within 10 to 14 days. </p> 
<p><strong>If your baby is younger than 2 to 3 months of age, call the doctor</strong> early in the illness. For newborns, a common cold can quickly develop into croup, pneumonia or another serious illness. Even without such complications, a stuffy nose can make it difficult for your baby to nurse or drink from a bottle. This can lead to dehydration. As your baby gets older, your doctor can guide you on when your baby needs to be seen by a doctor and when you can treat his or her cold at home. </p> 
<p>Most colds are simply a nuisance. But it's important to take your baby's signs and symptoms seriously. </p> 
<p><strong>If your baby is 3 months old or older, call the doctor if</strong> he or she: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Isn't wetting as many diapers as usual</li> 
 <li>Has a temperature higher than 100.4 F (38 C)</li> 
 <li>Seems to have ear pain or is unusually irritable</li> 
 <li>Has red eyes or develops yellow or greenish eye discharge</li> 
 <li>Has trouble breathing</li> 
 <li>Has a persistent cough</li> 
 <li>Has thick, green nasal discharge for several days</li> 
 <li>Has any other signs or symptoms that worry you</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Seek medical help immediately if</strong> your baby: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Refuses to nurse or accept fluids</li> 
 <li>Coughs hard enough to cause vomiting or changes in skin color</li> 
 <li>Coughs up blood-tinged sputum</li> 
 <li>Has difficulty breathing or is bluish around the lips and mouth</li> 
</ul>
