<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been called attention-deficit disorder (ADD) and hyperactivity. But ADHD is the preferred term because it includes the two main aspects of the condition: inattention and hyperactive-impulsive behavior. </p> 
<p>Adult ADHD symptoms may include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Trouble focusing or concentrating</li> 
 <li>Restlessness</li> 
 <li>Impulsivity</li> 
 <li>Difficulty completing tasks</li> 
 <li>Disorganization</li> 
 <li>Low frustration tolerance</li> 
 <li>Frequent mood swings</li> 
 <li>Hot temper</li> 
 <li>Trouble coping with stress</li> 
 <li>Unstable relationships</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Many adults with ADHD aren't aware they have it — they just know that everyday tasks can be a challenge. Adults with ADHD may find it difficult to focus and prioritize, leading to missed deadlines and forgotten meetings or social plans. The inability to control impulses can range from impatience waiting in line or driving in traffic to mood swings and outbursts of anger. </p> 
<p>All adults with ADHD had ADHD as children, even if it was never diagnosed. Some people with ADHD have fewer symptoms as they age, while others continue to have significant symptoms as adults. </p> 
<h3>What's normal and what's ADHD?</h3> 
<p>Almost everyone has some symptoms similar to ADHD at some point in their lives. If your difficulties are recent or occurred only occasionally in the past, you probably don't have ADHD. ADHD is diagnosed only when symptoms are severe enough to cause ongoing problems in more than one area of your life. These persistent and disruptive symptoms can be traced back to early childhood. </p> 
<p>Diagnosis of ADHD in adults can be difficult because certain ADHD symptoms are similar to those caused by other conditions, such as anxiety or mood disorders. And many adults with ADHD also have at least one other mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>If inattention, hyperactivity or impulsive behavior continually disrupts your life, talk to your doctor about whether you might have ADHD. Because signs of ADHD are similar to those of a number of other mental health conditions, you may not have ADHD — but you may have another condition that needs treatment. </p>
