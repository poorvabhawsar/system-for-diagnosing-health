<p>Sleepwalking is classified as a parasomnia — an undesirable behavior or experience during sleep. Sleepwalking is a parasomnia of arousal, meaning it occurs during deep, dreamless (non-rapid eye movement, or NREM) sleep. Someone who is sleepwalking may: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Sit up in bed and open his or her eyes </li> 
 <li>Have a glazed, glassy-eyed expression </li> 
 <li>Roam around the house, perhaps opening and closing doors or turning lights on and off </li> 
 <li>Do routine activities, such as getting dressed or making a snack — even driving a car </li> 
 <li>Speak or move in a clumsy manner </li> 
 <li>Scream, especially if also experiencing night terrors, another parasomnia in which you are likely to sit up, scream, talk, thrash and kick </li> 
 <li>Be difficult to wake up during an episode </li> 
</ul> 
<p>Sleepwalking usually occurs during deep sleep, early in the night — often one to two hours after falling asleep. Sleepwalking is unlikely to occur during naps. The sleepwalker won't remember the episode in the morning. </p> 
<p>Sleepwalking episodes can occur rarely or often, including multiple times a night for a few consecutive nights. </p> 
<p>Sleepwalking is common in children, who typically outgrow the behavior by their teens, as the amount of deep sleep they get decreases. </p> 
<p><strong>When to see a doctor<br /> </strong>Occasional episodes of sleepwalking aren't usually a cause for concern. You can simply mention the sleepwalking at a routine physical or well-child exam. However, consult your doctor if the sleepwalking episodes: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Become more frequent </li> 
 <li>Lead to dangerous behavior or injury </li> 
 <li>Are accompanied by other signs or symptoms </li> 
 <li>Continue into your child's teens </li> 
</ul>
