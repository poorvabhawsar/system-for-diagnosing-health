<h3>Forms of self-injury</h3> 
<p>One of the most common forms of self-injury is cutting, which involves making cuts or severe scratches on different parts of your body with a sharp object. Other forms of self-harm include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Burning (with lit matches, cigarettes or hot sharp objects like knives) </li> 
 <li>Carving words or symbols on the skin </li> 
 <li>Breaking bones </li> 
 <li>Hitting or punching </li> 
 <li>Piercing the skin with sharp objects </li> 
 <li>Head banging </li> 
 <li>Biting </li> 
 <li>Pulling out hair </li> 
 <li>Persistently picking at or interfering with wound healing </li> 
</ul> 
<p>Most frequently, the arms, legs and front of the torso are the targets of self-injury because these areas can be easily reached and easily hidden under clothing. But any area of the body may be used for self-injury. People who self-injure may use more than one method to harm themselves. </p> 
<p>Because self-injury is often an impulsive act, becoming upset can trigger an urge to self-injure. Many people self-injure only a few times and then stop. However, for others, self-injury can become a long-term, repetitive behavior. </p> 
<p>Although rare, some young people may self-injure in public or in groups to bond or to show others that they have experienced pain. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>Getting appropriate treatment can help you learn healthier ways to cope. </p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Reach out for help. </strong>If you're injuring yourself, even in a minor way, or if you have thoughts of harming yourself, reach out for help. Any form of self-injury is a sign of bigger issues that need to be addressed. Talk to someone you trust — such as a friend, loved one, health care provider, religious leader or a school official — who can help you take the first steps to successful treatment. While you may feel ashamed and embarrassed about your behavior, you can find supportive, caring and nonjudgmental help. </li> 
 <li><strong>Emergency help. </strong>If you've injured yourself severely or believe your injury may be life-threatening, call 911 or your local emergency services provider. </li> 
</ul> 
<h3>When a friend or loved one self-injures</h3> 
<p>If you have a friend or loved one who is self-injuring, you may be shocked and scared. Take all talk of self-injury seriously. Although you might feel that you'd be betraying a confidence, self-injury is too big a problem to ignore or to deal with alone. Here are some options for help. </p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Your child.</strong> You can start by consulting your pediatrician or family doctor who can provide an initial evaluation or a referral to a mental health specialist. Don't yell at your child or make threats or accusations, but do express concern. </li> 
 <li><strong>Teenage friend.</strong> Suggest that your friend talk to parents, a teacher, a school counselor or another trusted adult. </li> 
 <li><strong>Adult.</strong> Gently encourage the person to seek medical and psychological treatment. </li> 
</ul>
