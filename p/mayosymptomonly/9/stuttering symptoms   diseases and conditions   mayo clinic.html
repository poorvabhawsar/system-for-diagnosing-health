<p>Stuttering symptoms include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Difficulty starting a word, sentence or phrase </li> 
 <li>Repetition of a sound, syllable or word </li> 
</ul> 
<p>The speech difficulties of stuttering may be accompanied by: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Rapid eye blinks </li> 
 <li>Tremors of the lips or jaw </li> 
 <li>Tension, tightness or movement of the face or upper body </li> 
</ul> 
<p>Stuttering may be worse when you're excited, tired or under stress, or when you feel self-conscious, hurried or pressured. Situations such as speaking in front of a group or talking on the telephone can be particularly difficult for people who stutter. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>It's common for children between the ages of 2 and 5 to stutter. For most children, this is part of learning to speak, and it gets better on its own. However, stuttering that persists may require treatment to get better. </p> 
<p>Call your child's doctor for an appointment if stuttering: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Lasts more than six months </li> 
 <li>Becomes more frequent </li> 
 <li>Occurs along with facial tension or tightness </li> 
 <li>Occurs with other facial or body movements </li> 
 <li>Affects your child's schoolwork or social interactions </li> 
 <li>Causes emotional problems, such as fear or avoidance of situations in which your child has to talk </li> 
 <li>Continues beyond age 5 or first becomes noticeable when your child begins reading aloud in school </li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you're an adult who stutters, seek help if stuttering causes you stress or anxiety or affects your self-esteem, career or relationships. See your doctor or a speech-language pathologist, or search for a program designed to treat adult stuttering. </p>
