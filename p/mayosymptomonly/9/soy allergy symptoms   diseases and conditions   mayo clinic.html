<p>For most people, soy allergy is uncomfortable but not serious. Rarely, an allergic reaction to soy can be frightening and even life-threatening. Signs and symptoms of a food allergy usually develop within a few minutes to hours after eating a food containing soy. </p> 
<p>Soy allergy symptoms can include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Tingling in the mouth</li> 
 <li>Hives, itching or itchy, scaly skin (eczema)</li> 
 <li>Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other parts of the body</li> 
 <li>Wheezing, runny nose or trouble breathing</li> 
 <li>Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting</li> 
 <li>Redness of the skin (flushing)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>A severe allergic reaction to soy — called anaphylaxis — is rare. It's more likely to occur in people who have asthma or are also allergic to other foods such as peanuts. Anaphylaxis causes more extreme signs and symptoms including: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Constriction of airways, including a swollen throat or a lump in your throat, that makes it difficult to breathe</li> 
 <li>Shock, with a severe drop in blood pressure</li> 
 <li>Rapid pulse</li> 
 <li>Dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Soy allergy in infants often begins with the introduction of a soy-based formula. Soy allergy may develop when a child is switched to a soy-based formula after an allergic reaction to a milk-based formula. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>See your primary care doctor or a doctor who specializes in treating allergies (allergist) if you experience food allergy symptoms shortly after eating. If possible, see your doctor when the allergic reaction is occurring. </p> 
<p>Seek emergency treatment if you develop any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Constriction of airways that makes it difficult to breathe</li> 
 <li>Shock, with a severe drop in blood pressure</li> 
 <li>Rapid, weak pulse</li> 
 <li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li> 
 <li>Drooling with an inability to swallow</li> 
 <li>Difficulty breathing</li> 
 <li>Full-body redness and warmth (flushing)</li> 
</ul>
