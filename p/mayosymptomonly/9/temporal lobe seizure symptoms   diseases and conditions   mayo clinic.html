<p>An unusual sensation, known as an aura, may precede a temporal lobe seizure, acting as a warning. Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures experiences auras, and those who have auras may not remember them. The aura is actually a small seizure itself — one that has not spread into an observable seizure that impairs consciousness and ability to respond. Examples of auras include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>A sudden sense of unprovoked fear</li> 
 <li>A deja vu experience — a feeling that what's happening has happened before</li> 
 <li>The sudden occurrence of a strange odor or taste</li> 
 <li>A rising sensation in the abdomen</li> 
</ul> 
<p>People who have temporal lobe seizures can remain partially conscious during a seizure, but they also may lose awareness of their surroundings and often don't remember what happened. </p> 
<p>A temporal lobe seizure usually lasts 30 seconds to two minutes. Characteristic signs and symptoms of temporal lobe seizures include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Loss of awareness of surroundings</li> 
 <li>Staring</li> 
 <li>Lip smacking</li> 
 <li>Repeated swallowing or chewing</li> 
 <li>Unusual finger movements, such as picking motions</li> 
</ul> 
<p>After a temporal lobe seizure, you may have: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>A brief period of confusion and difficulty speaking</li> 
 <li>Inability to recall the events that occurred during the seizure</li> 
 <li>Unawareness of having had a seizure until someone else tells you</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In extreme cases, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure evolves into a grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizure — featuring convulsions and a loss of consciousness. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p><strong>Seek medical advice</strong> in these circumstances: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>If you think you're having seizures — early diagnosis is important</li> 
 <li>When the number or severity of seizures increases significantly without explanation</li> 
 <li>When new signs or symptoms of seizures appear</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Seek emergency medical care if: </h3> 
<ul> 
 <li>A seizure lasts more than five minutes</li> 
 <li>The person doesn't recover completely or as quickly as usual after the seizure is over</li> 
 <li>Rhythmic muscle contractions or jerky movements occur, which may indicate a grand mal seizure is developing</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If it appears a grand mal seizure may be developing: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Call for medical help immediately.</li> 
 <li>Gently roll the person onto one side and put something soft under his or her head.</li> 
 <li>Loosen tight neckwear.</li> 
 <li>Don't put anything in the mouth — the tongue can't be swallowed, and objects placed in the mouth can be bitten or inhaled.</li> 
 <li>Don't try to restrain the person. Look for a medical alert bracelet, which may indicate an emergency contact person and other information.</li> 
</ul>
