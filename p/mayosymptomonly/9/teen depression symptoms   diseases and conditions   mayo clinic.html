<p>Teen depression signs and symptoms include changes in your teen's emotions and behavior, such as the examples below. </p> 
<h3>Emotional changes</h3> 
<p>Be alert for emotional changes, such as: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Feelings of sadness, which can include crying spells for no apparent reason</li> 
 <li>Irritability, frustration or feelings of anger, even over small matters</li> 
 <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities</li> 
 <li>Loss of interest in, or conflict with, family and friends</li> 
 <li>Feelings of worthlessness, guilt, fixation on past failures or exaggerated self-blame or self-criticism</li> 
 <li>Extreme sensitivity to rejection or failure, and the need for excessive reassurance </li> 
 <li>Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things</li> 
 <li>Ongoing sense that life and the future are grim and bleak</li> 
 <li>Frequent thoughts of death, dying or suicide</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Behavioral changes</h3> 
<p>Watch for changes in behavior, such as: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Tiredness and loss of energy</li> 
 <li>Insomnia or sleeping too much</li> 
 <li>Changes in appetite, such as decreased appetite and weight loss, or increased cravings for food and weight gain</li> 
 <li>Use of alcohol or drugs</li> 
 <li>Agitation or restlessness — for example, pacing, hand-wringing or an inability to sit still</li> 
 <li>Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements</li> 
 <li>Frequent complaints of unexplained body aches and headaches, which may include frequent visits to the school nurse</li> 
 <li>Poor school performance or frequent absences from school</li> 
 <li>Neglected appearance — such as mismatched clothes and unkempt hair</li> 
 <li>Disruptive or risky behavior</li> 
 <li>Self-harm, such as cutting, burning, or excessive piercing or tattooing</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>What's normal and what's not</h3> 
<p>It can be difficult to tell the difference between ups and downs that are just part of being a teenager and teen depression. Talk with your teen. Try to determine whether he or she seems capable of managing challenging feelings, or if life seems overwhelming. </p> 
<p>If depression symptoms continue or begin to interfere in your teen's life, talk to a doctor or a mental health professional trained to work with adolescents. Your teen's family doctor or pediatrician is a good place to start. Or your teen's school may recommend someone. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>If you suspect your teenager is depressed, make a doctor's appointment as soon as you can. Depression symptoms likely won't get better on their own — and they may get worse or lead to other problems if untreated. Depressed teenagers may be at risk of suicide, even if signs and symptoms don't appear to be severe. </p> 
<p>If you're a teen and you think you may be depressed — or you have a friend who may be depressed — don't wait to get help. Talk to a health care professional such as your doctor or school nurse. Share your concerns with a parent, a close friend, a spiritual leader, a teacher or someone else you trust. </p> 
<h3>Suicidal thoughts</h3> 
<p>If your teen is having suicidal thoughts, get help right away. Take all talk of suicide seriously. Here are some steps you can take: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Call a suicide hotline number — in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255) to reach a trained counselor or encourage your teen to do so.</li> 
 <li>Seek help from your doctor, a mental health provider or other health care professional.</li> 
 <li>Reach out to family members, friends or spiritual leaders for support as you seek treatment for your teen.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>When to get emergency help</h3> 
<p>If you think your teen is in immediate danger of self-harm or attempting suicide, make sure someone stays with him or her. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or if you think you can do so safely, take your teen to the nearest hospital emergency department. </p>
