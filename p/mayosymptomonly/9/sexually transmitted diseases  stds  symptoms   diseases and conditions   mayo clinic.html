<p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have a range of signs and symptoms. That's why they may go unnoticed until complications occur or a partner is diagnosed. Signs and symptoms that might indicate an STI include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Sores or bumps on the genitals or in the oral or rectal area</li> 
 <li>Painful or burning urination</li> 
 <li>Discharge from the penis</li> 
 <li>Vaginal discharge</li> 
 <li>Unusual vaginal bleeding</li> 
 <li>Sore, swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the groin but sometimes more widespread</li> 
 <li>Lower abdominal pain</li> 
 <li>Rash over the trunk, hands or feet</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Signs and symptoms may appear a few days to years after exposure, depending on the organism. They may resolve in a few weeks, even without treatment, but progression with later complications — or recurrence — sometimes occurs. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p><strong>See a doctor immediately if:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>You are sexually active and you believe you've been exposed to an STI</li> 
 <li>You have signs and symptoms of an STI</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Make an appointment with a doctor </strong>for STI counseling and, if appropriate, screening tests: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>When you consider becoming sexually active, or when you're 21 — whichever comes first</li> 
 <li>Before you start having sex with a new partner</li> 
</ul>
