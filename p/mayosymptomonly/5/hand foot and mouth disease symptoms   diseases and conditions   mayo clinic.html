<p>Hand-foot-and-mouth disease may cause some or all of the following signs and symptoms: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Fever </li> 
 <li>Sore throat </li> 
 <li>Feeling of being unwell (malaise) </li> 
 <li>Painful, red, blister-like lesions on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks </li> 
 <li>A red rash, without itching but sometimes with blistering, on the palms, soles and sometimes the buttocks </li> 
 <li>Irritability in infants and toddlers </li> 
 <li>Loss of appetite </li> 
</ul> 
<p>The usual period from initial infection to the onset of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is three to seven days. A fever is often the first sign of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, followed by a sore throat and sometimes a poor appetite and malaise. One or two days after the fever begins, painful sores may develop in the mouth or throat. A rash on the hands and feet and possibly on the buttocks can follow within one or two days. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is usually a minor illness causing only a few days of fever and relatively mild signs and symptoms. Contact your doctor, however, if mouth sores or a sore throat keep your child from drinking fluids. Contact your doctor also if after a few days, your child's signs and symptoms worsen. </p>
