<h3>Infants</h3> 
<p>Most babies born to women carrying group B strep are healthy. But the few who are infected by group B strep during labor can become critically ill. </p> 
<p>In infants, illness caused by group B strep can take two forms: early onset or late onset. </p> 
<p><strong>Early-onset group B strep disease.</strong> A baby with early-onset group B strep disease becomes sick within one week after birth. Signs and symptoms may include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Fever</li> 
 <li>Difficulty feeding</li> 
 <li>Lethargy</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Late-onset group B strep disease.</strong> Late-onset group B strep disease develops within a week to a few months after birth, usually within the first month. Signs and symptoms may include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Difficulty breathing</li> 
 <li>Fever</li> 
 <li>Difficulty feeding</li> 
 <li>Lethargy</li> 
 <li>Irritability</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Adults</h3> 
<p>If you're like many adults, you may carry group B strep in your body, usually in your bowel, vagina, rectum, bladder or throat. Most adults simply carry the bacterium and have no signs or symptoms. </p> 
<p>In some cases, group B strep may cause a urinary tract infection or more serious infections such as blood infections (bacteremia) or pneumonia. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>As an adult, if you experience any signs or symptoms of group B strep infection — particularly if you're pregnant, you have a chronic medical condition or you're older than 65 — contact your doctor right away. </p> 
<p>If you notice your infant has any of the signs or symptoms of group B strep disease, tell your baby's doctor immediately. </p>
