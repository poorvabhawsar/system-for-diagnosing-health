<p>Hypochondria symptoms include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Having a long-term intense fear or anxiety about having a serious disease or health condition </li> 
 <li>Worrying that minor symptoms or bodily sensations mean you have a serious illness </li> 
 <li>Seeing doctors repeated times or having involved medical exams such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), echocardiograms or exploratory surgery </li> 
 <li>Frequently switching doctors â€” if one doctor tells you that you aren't sick, you may not believe it and seek out other opinions </li> 
 <li>Continuously talking about your symptoms or suspected diseases with family and friends </li> 
 <li>Obsessively doing health research </li> 
 <li>Frequently checking your body for problems, such as lumps or sores </li> 
 <li>Frequently checking your vital signs, such as pulse or blood pressure </li> 
 <li>Thinking you have a disease after reading or hearing about it </li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Hypochondria vs. normal worries</h3> 
<p>Not everyone who worries about health problems has hypochondria. Having symptoms caused by something you and your doctor can't identify clearly can cause anxiety. In some cases, a second opinion or further tests may be in order. </p> 
<p>However, if you start to search for ailments that seem to match your symptoms, chances are you'll find something. Minor ailments often share symptoms with more-serious disorders. It's become easier to search out health information on the Internet in recent years. Having easy access to information about every possible thing that could be wrong can fuel your anxiety. </p> 
<p>There's nothing wrong with informing yourself. Being an active participant in your own health is an important part of staying well. However, you may be crossing the line into hypochondria if you're consumed by the idea that something is seriously wrong even though you've had appropriate tests and reassurance from your doctor that everything's OK. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>If you have signs and symptoms of hypochondria, consider talking to a mental health provider such as a psychiatrist, psychologist or licensed counselor. You may decide to take the step yourself or a family member may suggest that you seek help. At some point, a doctor, nurse or other health care professional may suggest that you visit a mental health provider. </p> 
<p>It may seem to make no sense to visit a mental health provider when you're certain that you have a medical disease. But try to keep an open mind. Be willing to consider the possibility that your worries are based on your emotions rather than fact. Listen to the opinions of your family members and friends. </p> 
<p>Even if you don't have all of the symptoms of hypochondria, it's not a bad idea to talk to a mental health provider about your health worries. Hypochondria or not, ongoing worries about your health can make you miserable. Seeing a mental health provider for health anxiety may help. </p> 
<h3>Helping a loved one</h3> 
<p>If you have a loved one with signs and symptoms of hypochondria, have an open and honest discussion about your concerns and the things you've noticed. You may not be able to force someone to seek help for a mental health problem, but you can offer encouragement and support. You can also help your loved one find a qualified doctor or mental health provider and make an appointment. Offer to go to an appointment with him or her. </p>
