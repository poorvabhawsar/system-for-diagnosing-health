<p>Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the final months of development, the testicles gradually descend into the scrotum. If your son has a retractile testicle, the testicle originally descended as it should, but then it didn't remain in place. </p> 
<p>Signs and symptoms of a retractile testicle include the following: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>The testicle may be moved by hand from the groin into the scrotum and won't immediately retreat to the groin. </li> 
 <li>It may spontaneously appear in the scrotum and remain there for a time. </li> 
 <li>It may spontaneously disappear again for a time. </li> 
</ul> 
<p>The movement of the testicle almost always occurs without pain or discomfort. Therefore, a retractile testicle is noticed only when it is no longer seen or felt in the scrotum. </p> 
<p>The position of one testicle is usually independent of the position of the other one. For example, a boy may have one normal testicle and one retractile testicle. </p> 
<p>Retractile testicle is different from undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). The undescended testicle is one that never entered the scrotum. If a doctor attempted to guide an undescended testicle, it would cause discomfort or pain. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>During regular well-baby checkups and annual childhood checkups, your son's doctor examines your son's testicles to determine if they're descended and appropriately developed. If you believe that your son has a retractile or ascending testicle — or have other concerns about the development of his testicles — see his doctor. He or she will tell you how often to schedule checkups to monitor changes in the condition. </p> 
<p>If your son experiences pain in the groin or testicles, see your son's doctor immediately. </p>
