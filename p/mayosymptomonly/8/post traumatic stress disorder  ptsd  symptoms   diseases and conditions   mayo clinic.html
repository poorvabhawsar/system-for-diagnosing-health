<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms typically start within three months of a traumatic event. In a small number of cases, though, PTSD symptoms may not appear until years after the event. </p> 
<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms are generally grouped into three types: intrusive memories, avoidance and numbing, and increased anxiety or emotional arousal (hyperarousal). </p> 
<p>Symptoms of intrusive memories may include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Flashbacks, or reliving the traumatic event for minutes or even days at a time</li> 
 <li>Upsetting dreams about the traumatic event</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Symptoms of avoidance and emotional numbing may include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event</li> 
 <li>Feeling emotionally numb</li> 
 <li>Avoiding activities you once enjoyed</li> 
 <li>Hopelessness about the future</li> 
 <li>Memory problems</li> 
 <li>Trouble concentrating</li> 
 <li>Difficulty maintaining close relationships</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Symptoms of anxiety and increased emotional arousal may include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Irritability or anger</li> 
 <li>Overwhelming guilt or shame</li> 
 <li>Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much</li> 
 <li>Trouble sleeping</li> 
 <li>Being easily startled or frightened</li> 
 <li>Hearing or seeing things that aren't there</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms can come and go. You may have more post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms when things are stressful in general, or when you run into reminders of what you went through. You may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences, for instance. Or you may see a report on the news about a rape and feel overcome by memories of your own assault. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>It's normal to have a wide range of feelings and emotions after a traumatic event. You might experience fear and anxiety, a lack of focus, sadness, changes in how well you sleep or how much you eat, or crying spells that catch you off guard. You may have nightmares or be unable to stop thinking about the event. This doesn't mean you have post-traumatic stress disorder. </p> 
<p>But if you have these disturbing thoughts and feelings for more than a month, if they're severe, or if you feel you're having trouble getting your life back under control, talk to your health care professional. Getting treatment as soon as possible can help prevent PTSD symptoms from getting worse. </p> 
<p>In some cases, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may be so severe that you need emergency help, especially if you're thinking about harming yourself or someone else. If this happens, call 911 or other emergency medical service, or ask a supportive family member or friend for help. </p>
