 <h2>Symptoms</h2>

<p>You may have no obvious physical signs or symptoms when you have binge-eating disorder. You may be overweight or obese, or you may be at a normal weight. However, you likely have numerous behavioral and emotional signs and symptoms, such as: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Eating unusually large amounts of food </li> 
 <li>Eating even when you're full or not hungry </li> 
 <li>Eating rapidly during binge episodes </li> 
 <li>Eating until you're uncomfortably full </li> 
 <li>Frequently eating alone </li> 
 <li>Feeling that your eating behavior is out of control </li> 
 <li>Feeling depressed, disgusted, ashamed, guilty or upset about your eating </li> 
 <li>Experiencing depression and anxiety </li> 
 <li>Feeling isolated and having difficulty talking about your feelings </li> 
 <li>Frequently dieting, possibly without weight loss </li> 
 <li>Losing and gaining weight repeatedly, also called yo-yo dieting </li> 
</ul> 
<p>After a binge, you may try to diet or eat normal meals. But restricting your eating may simply lead to more binge eating, creating a vicious cycle. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>If you have any symptoms of binge-eating disorder, seek medical help as soon as possible. Binge-eating disorder usually doesn't get better by itself, and it may get worse if left untreated. </p> 
<p>Talk to your primary care doctor or a mental health provider about your binge-eating symptoms and feelings. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to someone you trust about what you're going through. A friend, loved one, teacher or faith leader can help you take the first steps to successful treatment of binge-eating disorder. </p> 
<h3>Helping a loved one who has symptoms</h3> 
<p>A person with binge-eating disorder can become an expert at hiding behavior, making it hard for others to detect the problem. If you have a loved one you think may have symptoms of binge-eating disorder, have an open and honest discussion about your concerns. You can offer encouragement and support and help your loved one find a qualified doctor or mental health provider and make an appointment. You may even offer to go along. </p>
