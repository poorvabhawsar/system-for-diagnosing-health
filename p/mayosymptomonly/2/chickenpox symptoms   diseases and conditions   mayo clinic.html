<p>Chickenpox infection usually lasts about five to 10 days. The rash is the telltale indication of chickenpox. Other signs and symptoms, which may appear one to two days before the rash, include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Fever </li> 
 <li>Loss of appetite </li> 
 <li>Headache </li> 
 <li>Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell (malaise) </li> 
</ul> 
<p>Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Raised pink or red bumps (papules), which break out over several days </li> 
 <li>Fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), forming from the raised bumps over about one day before breaking and leaking </li> 
 <li>Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take several more days to heal </li> 
</ul> 
<p>New bumps continue to appear for several days. As a result, you may have all three stages of the rash — bumps, blisters and scabbed lesions — at the same time on the second day of the rash. Once infected, you can spread the virus for up to 48 hours before the rash appears, and you remain contagious until all spots crust over. </p> 
<p>The disease is generally mild in healthy children. In severe cases, the rash can spread to cover the entire body, and lesions may form in the throat, eyes and mucous membranes of the urethra, anus and vagina. New spots continue to appear for several days. </p> 
<h4>When to see a doctor</h4> 
<p>If you suspect that you or your child has chickenpox, consult your doctor. He or she usually can diagnose chickenpox by examining the rash and by noting the presence of accompanying symptoms. Your doctor can also prescribe medications to lessen the severity of chickenpox and treat complications, if necessary. Be sure to call ahead for an appointment and mention you think you or your child has chickenpox, to avoid waiting and possibly infecting others in a waiting room. </p> 
<p>Also, be sure to let your doctor know if any of these complications occur: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>The rash spreads to one or both eyes. </li> 
 <li>The rash gets very red, warm or tender, indicating a possible secondary bacterial skin infection. </li> 
 <li>The rash is accompanied by dizziness, disorientation, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, tremors, loss of muscle coordination, worsening cough, vomiting, stiff neck or a fever higher than 103 F (39.4 C). </li> 
 <li>Anyone in the household is immune deficient or younger than 6 months old.</li> 
</ul>
