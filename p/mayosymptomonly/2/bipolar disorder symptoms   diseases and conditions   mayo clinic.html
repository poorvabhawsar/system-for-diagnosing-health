<p>Bipolar disorder is divided into several subtypes. Each has a different pattern of symptoms. Types of bipolar disorder include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Bipolar I disorder.</strong> Mood swings with bipolar I cause significant difficulty in your job, school or relationships. Manic episodes can be severe and dangerous.</li> 
 <li><strong>Bipolar II disorder.</strong> Bipolar II is less severe than bipolar I. You may have an elevated mood, irritability and some changes in your functioning, but generally you can carry on with your normal daily routine. Instead of full-blown mania, you have hypomania — a less severe form of mania. In bipolar II, periods of depression typically last longer than periods of hypomania.</li> 
 <li><strong>Cyclothymic disorder.</strong> Cyclothymic disorder, also known as cyclothymia, is a mild form of bipolar disorder. With cyclothymia, hypomania and depression can be disruptive, but the highs and lows are not as severe as they are with other types of bipolar disorder.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The exact symptoms of bipolar disorder vary from person to person. For some people, depression causes the most problems; for other people, manic symptoms are the main concern. Symptoms of depression and symptoms of mania or hypomania may also occur together. This is known as a mixed episode. </p> 
<h3>Manic phase of bipolar disorder</h3> 
<p>Signs and symptoms of the manic or hypomanic phase of bipolar disorder can include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Euphoria</li> 
 <li>Inflated self-esteem</li> 
 <li>Poor judgment</li> 
 <li>Rapid speech</li> 
 <li>Racing thoughts</li> 
 <li>Aggressive behavior</li> 
 <li>Agitation or irritation</li> 
 <li>Increased physical activity</li> 
 <li>Risky behavior</li> 
 <li>Spending sprees or unwise financial choices</li> 
 <li>Increased drive to perform or achieve goals</li> 
 <li>Increased sex drive</li> 
 <li>Decreased need for sleep</li> 
 <li>Easily distracted</li> 
 <li>Careless or dangerous use of drugs or alcohol</li> 
 <li>Frequent absences from work or school</li> 
 <li>Delusions or a break from reality (psychosis)</li> 
 <li>Poor performance at work or school</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Depressive phase of bipolar disorder</h3> 
<p>Signs and symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder can include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Sadness</li> 
 <li>Hopelessness</li> 
 <li>Suicidal thoughts or behavior</li> 
 <li>Anxiety</li> 
 <li>Guilt</li> 
 <li>Sleep problems</li> 
 <li>Low appetite or increased appetite</li> 
 <li>Fatigue</li> 
 <li>Loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable</li> 
 <li>Problems concentrating</li> 
 <li>Irritability</li> 
 <li>Chronic pain without a known cause</li> 
 <li>Frequent absences from work or school</li> 
 <li>Poor performance at work or school</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Other signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder</h3> 
<p>Signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder can also include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Seasonal changes in mood.</strong> As with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), some people with bipolar disorder have moods that change with the seasons. Some people become manic or hypomanic in the spring or summer and then become depressed in the fall or winter. For other people, this cycle is reversed — they become depressed in the spring or summer and manic or hypomanic in the fall or winter.</li> 
 <li><strong>Rapid cycling bipolar disorder.</strong> Some people with bipolar disorder have rapid mood shifts. This is defined as having four or more mood swings within a single year. However, in some people mood shifts occur much more quickly, sometimes within just hours.</li> 
 <li><strong>Psychosis.</strong> Severe episodes of either mania or depression may result in psychosis, a detachment from reality. Symptoms of psychosis may include false but strongly held beliefs (delusions) and hearing or seeing things that aren't there (hallucinations).</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Symptoms in children and adolescents</h3> 
<p>Instead of clear-cut depression and mania or hypomania, the most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents can include explosive temper, rapid mood shifts, reckless behavior and aggression. In some cases, these shifts occur within hours or less — for example, a child may have intense periods of giddiness and silliness, long bouts of crying and outbursts of explosive anger all in one day.</p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health provider. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health provider with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. </p> 
<p>Many people with bipolar disorder don't get the treatment they need. Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones. And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out — and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble.</p> 
<p>If you're reluctant to seek treatment, confide in a friend or loved one, a health care professional, a faith leader or someone else you trust. They may be able to help you take the first steps to successful treatment.</p> 
<h3>If you have suicidal thoughts</h3> 
<p>Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, get help right away. Here are some steps you can take: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Contact a family member or friend.</li> 
 <li>Seek help from your doctor, a mental health provider or other health care professional.</li> 
 <li>Call a suicide hot line number — in the United States, you can reach the toll-free, 24-hour hot line of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 to talk to a trained counselor.</li> 
 <li>Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone in your faith community.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>When to get emergency help</h3> 
<p>If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. If you have a loved one who has harmed himself or herself, or is seriously considering doing so, make sure someone stays with that person. Take him or her to the hospital or call for emergency help.</p>
