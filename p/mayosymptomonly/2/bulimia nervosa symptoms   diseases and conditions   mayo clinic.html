<p>Bulimia signs and symptoms may include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Being preoccupied with your body shape and weight </li> 
 <li>Living in fear of gaining weight </li> 
 <li>Feeling that you can't control your eating behavior </li> 
 <li>Eating until the point of discomfort or pain </li> 
 <li>Eating much more food in a binge episode than in a normal meal or snack </li> 
 <li>Forcing yourself to vomit or exercise too much </li> 
 <li>Misusing laxatives, diuretics or enemas after eating </li> 
 <li>Using dietary supplements or herbal products for weight loss </li> 
</ul> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>If you have any bulimia symptoms, seek medical help as soon as possible. If left untreated, it may get worse and take over your life. </p> 
<p>Talk to your primary care provider or a mental health provider about your bulimia symptoms and feelings. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, confide in someone about what you're going through, whether it's a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader or someone else you trust. He or she can help you take the first steps to successful bulimia treatment. </p> 
<h3>Helping a loved one with bulimia symptoms</h3> 
<p>If you think a loved one may have symptoms of bulimia, have an open and honest discussion about your concerns. You can't force someone to seek professional care, but you can offer encouragement and support. You can also help find a qualified doctor or mental health provider, make an appointment and even offer to go along. </p> 
<p>Because most people with bulimia are of normal weight or even slightly overweight, it may not be apparent to others that something is wrong. Red flags that family and friends may notice include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Constantly worrying or complaining about being fat </li> 
 <li>Having a distorted, excessively negative body image </li> 
 <li>Repeatedly eating unusually large quantities of food in one sitting, especially high-fat or sweet foods </li> 
 <li>Not wanting to eat in public or in front of others </li> 
 <li>Going to the bathroom right after eating or during meals </li> 
 <li>Exercising too much </li> 
 <li>Having sores, scars or calluses on the knuckles or hands </li> 
 <li>Having damaged teeth and gums </li> 
</ul>
