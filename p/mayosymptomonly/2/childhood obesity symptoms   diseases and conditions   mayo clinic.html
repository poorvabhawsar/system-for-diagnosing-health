<p>Not all children carrying extra pounds are overweight or obese. Some children have larger than average body frames. And children normally carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development. So you might not know just by looking at your child if his or her weight is a health concern.</p> 
<p>Your child's doctor can help you figure out if your child's weight could pose health problems using growth charts and, if necessary, other tests.</p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>If you're worried that your child is putting on too much weight, talk to his or her doctor. Your child's doctor will consider your child's individual history of growth and development, your family's weight-for-height history, and where your child lands on the growth charts. This can help determine if your child's weight is in an unhealthy range.</p>
