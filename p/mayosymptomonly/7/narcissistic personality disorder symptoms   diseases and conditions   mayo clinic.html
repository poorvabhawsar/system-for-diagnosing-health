<p>Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by dramatic, emotional behavior, which is in the same category as antisocial and borderline personality disorders. </p> 
<p>Narcissistic personality disorder symptoms may include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Believing that you're better than others</li> 
 <li>Fantasizing about power, success and attractiveness</li> 
 <li>Exaggerating your achievements or talents</li> 
 <li>Expecting constant praise and admiration</li> 
 <li>Believing that you're special and acting accordingly</li> 
 <li>Failing to recognize other people's emotions and feelings</li> 
 <li>Expecting others to go along with your ideas and plans</li> 
 <li>Taking advantage of others</li> 
 <li>Expressing disdain for those you feel are inferior</li> 
 <li>Being jealous of others</li> 
 <li>Believing that others are jealous of you</li> 
 <li>Trouble keeping healthy relationships</li> 
 <li>Setting unrealistic goals</li> 
 <li>Being easily hurt and rejected</li> 
 <li>Having a fragile self-esteem</li> 
 <li>Appearing as tough-minded or unemotional</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Although some features of narcissistic personality disorder may seem like having confidence or strong self-esteem, it's not the same. Narcissistic personality disorder crosses the border of healthy confidence and self-esteem into thinking so highly of yourself that you put yourself on a pedestal. In contrast, people who have healthy confidence and self-esteem don't value themselves more than they value others. </p> 
<p>When you have narcissistic personality disorder, you may come across as conceited, boastful or pretentious. You often monopolize conversations. You may belittle or look down on people you perceive as inferior. You may have a sense of entitlement. And when you don't receive the special treatment to which you feel entitled, you may become very impatient or angry. You may insist on having &quot;the best&quot; of everything — the best car, athletic club, medical care or social circles, for instance. </p> 
<p>But underneath all this behavior often lies a fragile self-esteem. You have trouble handling anything that may be perceived as criticism. You may have a sense of secret shame and humiliation. And in order to make yourself feel better, you may react with rage or contempt and efforts to belittle the other person to make yourself appear better. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>When you have narcissistic personality disorder, you may not want to think that anything could be wrong — doing so wouldn't fit with your self-image of power and perfection. But by definition, a narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of your life, such as relationships, work, school or your financial affairs. You may be generally unhappy and confused by a mix of seemingly contradictory emotions. Others may not enjoy being around you, and you may find your relationships unfulfilling. </p> 
<p>If you notice any of these problems in your life, consider reaching out to a trusted doctor or mental health provider. Getting the right treatment can help make your life more rewarding and enjoyable. </p>
