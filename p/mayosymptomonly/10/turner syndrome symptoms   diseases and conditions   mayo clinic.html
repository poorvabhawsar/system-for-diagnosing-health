<h3>At birth or during infancy</h3> 
<p>Signs and symptoms of Turner syndrome may vary significantly. In some girls, a number of physical features and poor growth are apparent early. Signs and symptoms that may be apparent at birth or during infancy include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Wide or web-like neck </li> 
 <li>Receding or small lower jaw </li> 
 <li>High, narrow roof of the mouth (palate) </li> 
 <li>Low-set ears </li> 
 <li>Low hairline at the back of the head </li> 
 <li>Drooping eyelids </li> 
 <li>Broad chest with widely spaced nipples </li> 
 <li>Short fingers and toes </li> 
 <li>Arms that turn outward at the elbows (cubitus valgus) </li> 
 <li>Fingernails turned upward </li> 
 <li>Swelling of the hands and feet, especially at birth </li> 
 <li>Slightly smaller than average height at birth </li> 
 <li>Delayed growth </li> 
 <li>Sensitivity to noise </li> 
</ul> 
<h3>In older girls, adolescents and young women</h3> 
<p>For some girls, the presence of Turner syndrome may not be readily apparent. Signs and symptoms in older girls, adolescents and young women that may indicate Turner syndrome include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>No growth spurts at expected times in childhood </li> 
 <li>Short stature, with an adult height of about 8 inches (20 centimeters) less than might be expected for a female member of her family </li> 
 <li>Learning disabilities, particularly with learning that involves spatial concepts or math, though intelligence is usually normal </li> 
 <li>Difficulty in social situations, such as problems understanding other people's emotions or reactions </li> 
 <li>Failure to begin sexual changes expected during puberty â€” due to ovarian failure that may have occurred by birth or gradually during childhood, adolescence or young adulthood </li> 
 <li>Sexual development that &quot;stalls&quot; </li> 
 <li>Early end to menstrual cycles not due to pregnancy </li> 
 <li>For most women with Turner syndrome, inability to conceive a child without fertility treatment </li> 
</ul> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>Most signs and symptoms of Turner syndrome aren't specific to this disorder. Therefore, it's important to get a prompt diagnosis and appropriate care. See your doctor if you believe your daughter shows signs of Turner syndrome or if you have concerns about her physical, sexual or behavioral development. </p>
