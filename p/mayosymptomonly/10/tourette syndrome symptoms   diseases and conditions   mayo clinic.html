<p>Tics — sudden, brief, intermittent movements or sounds — are the hallmark sign of Tourette syndrome. Symptoms range from mild to severe. Severe symptoms may significantly interfere with communication, daily functioning and quality of life. </p> 
<p>Tics are classified as either: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Simple tics,</strong> which are sudden, brief and repetitive, involving a limited number of muscle groups</li> 
 <li><strong>Complex tics,</strong> which are distinct, coordinated patterns of movements that involve several muscle groups</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Tics involving movement (motor tics) — often facial tics, such as blinking — usually begin before vocal tics do. But the spectrum of tics that people experience is diverse, and there's no typical case. </p>

<p>In addition, if you have Tourette syndrome, your tics may: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Vary in type, frequency and severity</li> 
 <li>Worsen if you're ill, stressed, anxious, tired or excited</li> 
 <li>Occur during sleep</li> 
 <li>Evolve into different tics over time</li> 
 <li>Worsen during teenage years and improve during the transition into adulthood</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Before the onset of motor or vocal tics, you'll likely experience an urge called a premonitory urge. A premonitory urge is an uncomfortable bodily sensation, such as an itch, a tingle or tension. Expression of the tic brings relief. </p> 
<p>With great effort, some people with Tourette syndrome can temporarily stop a tic or hold back tics until they find a place where it's less disruptive to express them. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>If you notice your child displaying involuntary movements or sounds, schedule an appointment with your pediatrician. Not all tics indicate Tourette syndrome. </p> 
<p>Many children develop tics lasting a few weeks or months that go away on their own. But whenever a child shows unusual behavior, it's important to have a medical evaluation to identify the cause and rule out serious health problems. </p>
