<p>Vaginitis signs and symptoms may include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Change in color, odor or amount of discharge from your vagina</li> 
 <li>Vaginal itching or irritation</li> 
 <li>Pain during intercourse</li> 
 <li>Painful urination</li> 
 <li>Light vaginal bleeding or spotting</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The characteristics of vaginal discharge may indicate the type of vaginitis you have. Examples include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Bacterial vaginosis.</strong> You may develop a grayish-white, foul-smelling discharge. The odor, often described as fish-like, may be more obvious after sexual intercourse.</li> 
 <li><strong>Yeast infection.</strong> The main symptom is itching, but you may have a white, thick discharge that resembles cottage cheese.</li> 
 <li><strong>Trichomoniasis.</strong> An infection called trichomoniasis (trik-o-moe-NIE-uh-sis) can cause a greenish yellow, sometimes frothy discharge.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>See your doctor if you develop any unusual vaginal discomfort, especially if:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>You've never had a vaginal infection. Seeing your doctor can establish the cause and help you learn to identify the signs and symptoms.</li> 
 <li>You've had vaginal infections before, but in this case, it seems different.<i></i></li> 
 <li>You've had multiple sex partners or a recent new partner. You could have a sexually transmitted infection. The signs and symptoms of some sexually transmitted infections are similar to those of a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis.</li> 
 <li>You've completed a course of over-the-counter anti-yeast medication and your symptoms persist, you have a fever, or you have a particularly unpleasant vaginal odor. These are signs the infection may be from something other than yeast or from a resistant strain of yeast.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Wait-and-see approach</h3> 
<p>You probably don't need to see your doctor every time you have vaginal irritation and discharge, particularly if:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>You've previously had a diagnosis of vaginal yeast infections and your signs and symptoms are the same as before</li> 
 <li>You know the signs and symptoms of a yeast infection and you're confident that you have a yeast infection</li> 
</ul>
