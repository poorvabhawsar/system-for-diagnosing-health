<p>Exercise-induced asthma symptoms can include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Coughing </li> 
 <li>Wheezing </li> 
 <li>Shortness of breath </li> 
 <li>Chest tightness or pain </li> 
 <li>Fatigue during exercise </li> 
 <li>Poor athletic performance </li> 
</ul> 
<p>Exercise-induced asthma symptoms may start a few minutes after you begin exercising, and they may continue to worsen for another 10 minutes or so after you've finished a workout. It's possible to have symptoms both during and after exercise. </p> 
<p>Feeling a little short of breath or fatigued when you work out is normal, especially if you aren't in great shape. But with exercise-induced asthma, these symptoms can be more severe. </p> 
<p>For many people, exercise is just one of a few asthma triggers. Others can include pollen, pet dander and other airborne allergens. </p> 
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3> 
<p>See your doctor if you cough, wheeze, or have chest pain or tightness during or after exercise. Many people don't realize they have exercise-induced asthma because they think these are their body's normal responses to working out. Don't assume your symptoms are caused by being out of shape or short on endurance. </p> 
<p><strong>Seek immediate medical treatment</strong> if you have worsening symptoms. Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Signs of an asthma attack that needs emergency treatment include: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Shortness of breath or wheezing that is quickly getting worse </li> 
 <li>No improvement even after using a rescue inhaler, such as an albuterol inhaler </li> 
 <li>Shortness of breath that continues even after you've recovered from your workout </li> 
</ul>
